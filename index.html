                <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT WG FITNESS</h2>
                <p>Personal and group fitness training located in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs, WG Fitness aims to make health and
                  fitness fun and one of the most important priorities of your week. Wayne can do this by encouraging and
                  challenging you in a way that gets you to ask more of yourself both with the intensity at which you are
                  training and with the food and lifestyle choices you are making. I aim to give you the awareness so as
                  these two ingredients become second nature. The majority of my clients are time poor, so I ensure that
                  their fitness sessions with me are the most productive form of exercise that they do that week.
                  <br>
                  <br> I believe being happy, which goes hand in hand with being fit and healthy. Sometimes that may require
                  sacrifices in other areas of your life. I don’t believe in diets, 6 week boot camps or anything that is
                  looking for a quick solution. I believe that eating healthy, plenty of rest and quality time productive
                  exercise is a lifestyle!

                <div class="testimonial-text">
                  <p>I started training with Wayne over ten years ago and I hope I have the pleasure of continuing to train
                    with him for as long as he continues to train clients! After five years of full time study juggled with
                    full time work I was unfit, overweight and in complete denial about the state of my health. The first
                    session started with a lap of the oval I struggled to complete and finished with me sat in the car determined
                    to make sure this was the beginning of a health overhaul I clearly needed. Now, travelling between Sydney,
                    Melbourne and Canada with a demanding job and with a routine that means my regular 3-4 times weekly Wayne
                    sessions aren’t possible I understand the influence Wayne has had in my life. There is no doubt my professional
                    success, stamina, mental strength and general health are all what they are today in no small part because
                    of the training I have done with Wayne. I also know finding a “Wayne” is no easy feat…I’m yet to find
                    anyone who close to being of the same standard in Melbourne or in Toronto despite my best efforts! Training
                    with Wayne is not a boot camp or a twelve week fitness challenge– training with Wayne is about becoming
                    part of a community, adopting a healthier lifestyle, making better choices. Wayne will continually challenge
                    you to achieve and wants you to be responsible for your choices and your health…he will help, but you
                    have to do the work and make the changes. The training is fun and varied and every day part of it is
                    tough – in fact some days all of it is tough – but that variation is what keeps you coming back. The
                    fitness level within Wayne’s regular clients is not only a testament to Wayne but it is inspiring and
                    the support they offer to those around them is further testament to the community of people Wayne builds.
                    If you want to just turn up and train, find a gym, if you want to be challenged, change your lifestyle,
                    hear the hard truth and train with someone who, if you have faith, will help you change your life, train
                    with Wayne.</p>

                  <p>I have trained with Wayne for over a decade 2-3 times a week. Waynes desire to be at the forefront of new
                    training regimes ‎in an ever-changing world of fitness not only challenges Wayne but his clients as well.
                    Wayne has the ability to recognise his clients achievements no matter how minor they are which I know
                    not only just for me but his clients as well make each and every one us want to push harder and achieve
                    even better results than our previous session. I will continue to train with Wayne for as long as my
                    body will permit me and for as long as Waynes wants to train. He’s a great trainer, a great friend and
                    someone who I trust implicitly.</p>

                  <p>I have been lucky enough to be a part of Wayne’s group for over 10 years now. There is something very unique
                    about the service Wayne provides. It is so much more than personal training and I think that is what
                    contributes so significantly to the results we all get. He values each individual and inspires us through
                    what is a very personal approach despite the group format. He has an incredible capacity to motivate
                    and I have witnessed people of all fitness levels achieve things they didn’t think were possible.
                    <br> I have seen Wayne refine his training over many years, ensuring we are always engaged in the most effective
                    training methods possible. The fact that even after 10 years I still end up with that satisfying muscles
                    soreness each week is indicative of how varied and ever challenging the training is. Not only do you
                    see incredible results and changes in your body and fitness level but Wayne changes your outlook on life.
                    I am a more positive, happy, well rounded person because of Wayne and will be forever grateful for the
                    huge role he plays in my life.</p>

                  <p>Wayne is a legend in our (cricket) club. He gets results because he knows and respects people. The players
                    respond to his positive, vibrant nature.His sessions are challenging but meaningful,not just a hard slog.
                    I think this is his point of difference. There’s a strong sense of achievement and self worth after a
                    session with Geebs.

                  <p>I stumbled into my first training session with Wayne in October 2012, and almost passed out after 20 minutes
                    – fast forward 6 months and i’m as fit as i’ve ever been! It is no overstatement to say that training
                    with Wayne Geber has changed my life in a very positive way. I went from an occasional exerciser to someone
                    who loves getting up at 5.40am,  3 mornings a week to train.
                    <br> I’m a lot fitter, and lot healthier! Wayne’s sessions are fantastic – they build muscle and fitness
                    fast, and are a lot of fun. The team I train with are all great people, and we love motivating each other
                    to push that little harder! Wayne is an exceptional trainer, and his concern for his clients, and the
                    variety of the sessions means it’s pretty easy  to get out of bed on those cold winter mornings!
                    <br> Hopefully I’ll still be getting up early for many more years to train with Wayne, I absolutely love
                    it.

                  <p>I’ve known and have trained with Wayne Geber for years. With the amount of cricket I am playing around
                    the world it is hard to get into a regular fitness regime. Wayne is always coming up with short intense
                    routines for me that I can do in my own time before and after cricket training. These routines keep me
                    fresh and sharp and are always a challange. Whenever I am back in Sydney I always make sure Wayne and
                    I can train together. I appreciate his honesty and he will always let me know where my fitness levels
                    are at.</p>

                    together before I joined the Dragons in 2008 and continues to be there. I will team up with him to get
                    a workout in whenever I am in Sydney. He loves what he does and its contagious to those around him. So

                  <p>I have been a client of Wayne’s for over 11 years,and I can say it’s the best money I have ever spent.
                    I have been involved with a number of personal trainers previously,but nothing comes close. Each session
                    is truly invigorating, and you finish it with a true sense of accomplishment. But it is not only the
                    superb training sessions that seperates him from the rest, it is care and committment shown by Wayne
                    that gives his training the extra edge. Whether it be helping with your diet, organising cross training,
                    putting on client seminars, or taking clients on overseas training trips, Wayne always goes that extra
                    yard…that’s what makes him the best in the business, a true lifestyle coach.</p>

                  <p>Over the past 10 years since starting with Wayne my body and my way of life has changed dramatically. From
                    approaching my 50′s with an attitude of what will be will be and let that middle age spread take over
                    to being fit and healthy and have more of a can do attitude.
                    <br>
                    <br> Wayne has a wonderfully encouraging and positive manner. He knows when to push and when to back off.
                    As a result I want to improve for the both of us. Our week in Hawaii suited me down to the ground. Everyone
                    was committed to making an effort in every session, no matter what fitness level we all mixed well together.
                    A great group and a great result for me. All my friends comment on the physical change in me and how
                    well I look!</p>

                  <p>As a fellow health professional that has known and trained with Wayne (Gebes) for numerous years, the best
                    way for me to describe him and his work ethic is to relate him to what I call the 4 Hs: Honour / Honesty
                    / Humility / Humour
                    <br>
                    <br> It is through the above characteristics that makes Gebes what he is today, that is a health professional
                    who has a passion and a belief in making people better physically and mentally through exercise.
                    <br>
                    <br> I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Gebes and his services to someone who is looking for
                    the best in the personal training field. I wish Gebes continued success with his business and congratulate
                    him on his awesome web site.</p>

                  <p>Over the last 8 years I have regularly trained with Wayne through his morning Group sessions. This has
                    improved my fitness, wellbeing and my general happiness. He is constantly challenging my body and my
                    determintation through his varied fitness routines. He is always encouraging, positive, extremely knowledgeable
                    and prepared for his sessions. It is actually a pleasure to spend two mornings with him a week
                    <br>
                    <br> Wayne actually prepares and thinks about each particular session and each of his clients. I have trained
                    with other trainers, but felt like they were just going through the motions. I have witnessed Wayne planning
                    out his sessions in advance, and the group benefits from this planning and care.
                    <br>
                    <br> Wayne is always thinking of ways to challenge the group</p>

                  <p>There are a couple of reasons why I’d recommend Wayne:
                    <br>– he’s a good bloke and very motivating
                    <br>– he makes every client feel like they are his most important
                    <br>– most of his clients, like me, have been training with him for many years, once you start it’s hard
                    to stop!
                    <br>
                    <br> So with all that, if you are looking for a great personal trainer that makes sessions varied and enjoyable,
                    Wayne’s your man.

                    I loved working out with Wayne, and my group, because we pushed each other. He is a really personable
                    guy, who has a knack of motivating you without being one of those annoying trainers.
                    <br>
                    <br> It almost feels like your letting him down if you don’t go that extra yard. I’ve since moved to Melbourne
